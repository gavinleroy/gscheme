# GScheme

GScheme is a small scheme implementation that will grow over a long time. Currently, it is based off the lambda calculus and Matthew Flatt's [*Let's Build a Hygenic Macro Expander*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or_yKiI3Ha4) talk at Strange Loop 2016.
The Racket macro expander and the previous *smaller* inspirations are found [here across branches](https://github.com/mflatt/expander).

## Progress

I will indicate progress here to give a rough estimate of what is accomplished.
