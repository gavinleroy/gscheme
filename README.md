# GScheme

GScheme is a small scheme implementation that will grow over a long time to eventually reach a near implementation of the [Revised 6th Report of the Algorithmic Language Scheme](http://www.r6rs.org/). 

Currently, GScheme is based off the lambda calculus and Matthew Flatt's [*Let's Build a Hygenic Macro Expander*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or_yKiI3Ha4) talk at Strange Loop 2016.
The Racket macro expander and the previous *smaller* inspirations are found [here across branches](https://github.com/mflatt/expander).

## Progress

I will indicate progress here to give a rough estimate of what is accomplished, it should be noted that the macro expander is not available on the top-level.

- [X] pico : expander with lambda calculus
- [X] nano : implicit quoting, multi-arg lambdas
- [ ] mini
- [ ] micro
- [ ] demi
